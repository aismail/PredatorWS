Jason Project to demostrate how to use compiler directives.

Agent a uses a pre-defined directive known as declarative
goal (DG) and is implemented by means of goal patterns that 
are proposed in the paper: 
  Jomi Fred Hubner, Rafael H. Bordini, and Michael Wooldridge. 
  Programming declarative goals using plan patterns. 
  In Matteo Baldoni and Ulle Endriss, editors, Proceedings of the 
  Fourth International Workshop on Declarative Agent Languages and 
  Technologies (DALT 2006), held with AAMAS 2006, 8th May, Hakodate, 
  Japan, pages 65-81. Springer, 2006.
See the code of agent a for more information.

Agent b uses an user-defined directive. This directive, called
LoggerDirective (LD), add some code in the begin and in the end of 
a set of plans.  User directives should be declared in the
project file (see the end of this file).
