/* Jason Project 

   Example of chain belief bases. 
   
   The agent bob uses two customisations of BB:
   one to persist the beliefs and 
   another to have a kind of key based BB.

   To see the effect of the two BBs, run the program
   and, when finished, click on "Debug" mode and then 
   select "bob" agent. Notice that the 'boss' beliefs have
   unique keys. If you run the program again you will 
   note that beliefs added in previous executions
   are persisted (they are stored in the bob.bb file).
