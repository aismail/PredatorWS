/* Jason Project 

This project shows how the Contract Net Protocol (CNP) 
can be implemented with Jason. It exemplifies only the
communication no actions are actually performed.

The agent c plays the initiator (who need a service) 
and the agents p* play participant (who provide a service).

For more information about the CNP see
