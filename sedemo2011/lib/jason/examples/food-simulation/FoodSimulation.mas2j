/*

The environment implementation provides the following perception and actions

Percepts:
.  step(X): the step X has started.

.  food(X,Y,P,O): food perception
     X is the column
     Y is the line
     P can be
        my_pos if the food is the same location as the agent
        see    if the food is in the agent's territory
        smell  if the food is two steps away from the agent
     O is the agent allocated to the food, -1 if none
     
.  pos(AgId,X,Y): agent position
     AgId the agent's identification in the environment
    
.  agent(AgId, X, Y, S, A): perception of other agents in the agent's territory
     AgId is the identification of the other agent
     S is its strength
     A is its action (moving or eating)
     
.  strength(S): the strength of the agent

.  attacked(AgId,Name): the agent is beign attacked by AgId



Actions:
.  eat
.  move(X,Y)
.  attack(X,Y)
.  random_move
.  pause
