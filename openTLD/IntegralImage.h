/*  An integral image, or summed area table, allows fast computation of 
    rectangular areas of pixel intensities in an image.
    
    Computed by:
        I(x, y) = i(x, y) + I(x - 1, y) + I(x, y - 1) - I(x - 1, y - 1)
        where I is the integral image and i is the original image.
    
    The intensity sum of a rectangle can then be computed by:
        top-left + bottom-right - top-right - bottom-left
    
    Integral images are stored in a 2D array as such:
        0 0 0 0 0 0
        0 - - - - -
        0 - - - - -
        0 - - - - -
        0 - - - - -
    
    where width = image width + 1, height = image height + 1, dashes represent
    elements containing sums from the original image, and zeros represent the
    top row and left column, which hold only zeros. */
